        Why will people come to your site?</p>
        <hr>
        <p>My portfolio website is a unique platform where I can showcase my work, skills, and potential. It is my digital business card and a marketing tool. But why would people visit my site?

Primarily, people visit my portfolio website to view my work. As a professional, my portfolio is a testament to my skills and abilities.

Visitors are also interested in learning about me. My portfolio website is where I share my story, my journey, my inspirations, and my values. A well-crafted ‘About Me’ section helps me connect with my audience on a personal level.

Potential clients or employers may visit my site to assess my suitability for a project or job. Therefore, my portfolio includes detailed descriptions of my work, the processes involved, and the results achieved.

If visitors are impressed by what they see, they’ll want to get in touch. Hence, I make sure that my contact information is easily accessible.

Lastly, if I maintain a blog on my portfolio site, visitors might come to read my thoughts on industry trends, project case studies, or useful tips and tutorials.

        What questions would visitors expect on the site.</p>
        <hr>
<p>My portfolio website is more than just a showcase of my work; it's a platform for communication and connection. Visitors to my site likely have several questions they expect my site to answer:

Visitors want to know who I am. This is the most fundamental question. My 'About Me' page provides a brief introduction to who I am, my background, and what drives me.

Visitors are interested in understanding my skills and areas of expertise. This is demonstrated through my showcased work and also explicitly stated in my bio or resume.

My portfolio clearly displays my past projects, including the objectives, my role, the process, and the outcomes. This gives visitors an idea of my experience and what I'm capable of.

Visitors are curious about my style or approach. While my work speaks to my style, I find it helpful to articulate my unique approach or philosophy towards my work.

If a visitor is interested in my work, they'll want to know how to get in touch with me. I ensure that my contact information is easy to find and up-to-date.

Testimonials or endorsements can add credibility to my portfolio. If I have these, I make sure they're visible.

A blog or news section keeps visitors updated on my latest projects or thoughts.

In conclusion, my portfolio website is a reflection of me. It not only answers these questions but also leaves a lasting impression that sets me apart.
